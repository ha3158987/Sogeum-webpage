        <p>Cats use vocalizations to express emotion. <br><br>Meowing, purring, hisses, growls, and more are included in the feline repertoire, each with special meanings depending on their context. While adult cats normally don't meow at each other, domesticated cats have learned to meow at humans. Some scientists think this is a sign that cats see their owners as kittens because generally only mother cats and their kittens communicate through meowing.<p>
        <p style="margin-top:30px;">Cats also express emotion with their ears, as well as intent. <br>Forward-facing ears express interest. Generally speaking, the more a cat’s ears swivel sideways and backward, the greater the cat’s arousal or distress. Backward ears and a hiss or swipe ​are a sure sign your cat feels threatened or doesn't like what you're doing.</p>
